    <h1> Learning Sass</h1>
    <p>What is Sass?
        Sass is a CSS renderer.

        A CSS preprocessor is a tool that allows us to automatically generate style sheets, adding features that CSS
        does not have, and that are typical of programming languages, such as variables, functions, nested selectors,
        inheritance, etc.

        These characteristics of the processors also allow us to make the generated CSS easier to maintain and more
        reusable. </p>

        <h1>Sass Basics</h1>
        <p>Preprocessing: <br>CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to
            maintain. This is
            where a preprocessor can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables,
            nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again.

            Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS
            file that you can use in your website.

            The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed, you can compile your
            Sass to CSS using the sass command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output
            CSS to. For example, running sass input.scss output.css from your terminal would take a single Sass file,
            input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.</p>
